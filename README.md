Work in progress version of code to (1) reconstruct historic harvest of Atnarko Sockeye in directed, mixed stock and incidental fisheries on the Central Coast of BC (2) fit an age-structured state-space stock-recruit model to available data to inform simulations that quantify the impact of plausible future harvest rates on prospects for recovery and (3) develop a simple generalized migration, harvest and catch monitoring simulation to evaluate how well alternative catch sampling strategies reduce uncertainty in estimates of catch composition.

Stock-recruit model is modified from: Fleischman, S.J., Catalano, M.J., Clark, R.A. and Bernard, D.R., 2013. An age-structured state-space stock?recruit model for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 70(3): 401-414.
